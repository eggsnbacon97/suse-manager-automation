## Goals of SUMA Update Automation - 

1. Improve the overall update process of clients and make it more or less "unattended".
2. Improve the visibility and notification process of the actual Suse Manager.
3. Create a risk management system that informs administrators of:
    - Update criticality 
    - Compatibility with current packages and systems
    - Downtime requirements
